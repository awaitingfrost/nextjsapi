        Bootstrap 5 is evolving with each release to better utilize CSS
        variables for global theme styles, individual components, and even
        utilities. We provide dozens of variables for colors, font styles, and
        more at a :root level for use anywhere. On components and utilities, CSS
        variables are scoped to the relevant class and can easily be modified.
      </p>
